## What is CircleFi?

CircleFi takes the age-old tradition of community savings circles and makes them secure, transparent, and accountable. Members contribute monthly to a shared pot, and each round one member receives the full pot. No banks, no middlemen — just your community.

**Hybrid Architecture:** Pay through GCash, Maya, or bank transfer. Every transaction is verified and recorded on the blockchain for full transparency.

## Key Features

- **Smart Vouch** — Auto risk-check on invites. New members need a voucher who stakes a 50% bond
- **Discount Bidding** — Highest discount wins the pot early. The discount is split as dividends to all members
- **Manager Career Path** — Rookie → Captain → Banker with increasing fees and responsibilities
- **Trust Ratings** — Community-driven 1-5★ ratings with auto-demotion below 4.0★
- **Circle Chat & DMs** — Group messaging per circle plus private DMs across your trust network
- **Blockchain Verified** — Every payment and payout recorded on-chain for tamper-proof transparency
- **Geo Discovery** — Find circles near you sorted by distance

## How It Works

1. **Join a Circle** — Browse nearby circles. 4.0★+ members join directly; others need a vouch
2. **Contribute Monthly** — Pay via GCash/Maya. Bid dividends reduce what you owe
3. **Bid for the Pot** — Need money early? Offer the highest discount to win
4. **Get Your Payout** — Receive the pot on your turn, minus discount and fees
